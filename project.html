						<h2>Final Project</h2>
						<br>
						<h3>Description:</h3>
						<p>
							This is by far the largest component of the course.
							You will discover, explore, and attack a real world
							problem of your choosing.
							There are <b> three </b> types of projects you
							can work on, shown below in order of increasing difficulty:
						</p>

						<ul>
							<li>
								(1) Application of existing algorithm to a new problem and
								potentially new data.
							</li>
							<li>
								(2) Algorithmic work. Extend an existing algorithm
	              or conceive a new one to solve some problem.
	              This inherently includes the first option because you will
	              need to test this new algorithm on data.
							</li>

							<li>
								(3) Theoretical work. Create a new convergence bound
	              on a learning algorithm. Show that at some limit
	              one learning algorithm becomes another. Etc.
							</li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							These also have increasing risk. For example, you cannot
	            turn in a paper saying you worked on a convergence bound
	            for months with no results. Option two has medium risk because
	            part of the process of creating a new algorithm is creating
	            baselines to improve upon.
	            At <i>any</i> time during the course <i>please</i> feel free
	            to come and discuss your problem and ask questions with the
	            instructor or TAs.
					</p>

					<h3>Requirements:</h3>
						All of the requirements below must be satisfied in order
						to receive full credits for the project:

					<ul>
						<br>
						<li>
							&#9679; <b><i>Partner:</i></b> <br>
							Maximum of 1 partner (we may concede to 2 partners
              in extreme scenarios eg. huge coding project). All
              partners must contribute equally.
						</li>

						<li>
							&#9679; <b><i>Dataset:</i></b> <br>
							You must use at least one dataset with at least
							one million data points as a significant part of
							your project.
						</li>

						<li>
							&#9679; <b><i>Format:</i></b> <br>
							Your submission must be submitted as a pdf in
							 <a href="https://nips.cc/Conferences/2016/PaperInformation/AuthorSubmissionInstructions">NIPS format</a>.
							 Note that this means you must use LaTeX with their
							 <a href="https://nips.cc/Conferences/2016/PaperInformation/StyleFiles">style file</a>.
							 (NIPS, Neural Information Processing Systems,
							 is one of the major machine learning conferences).
						</li>

						<li>
							&#9679; <b><i>Code Style:</i></b> <br>
							All code used in the production of your final report should be clean
              <a href="https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/">
								(suggested format)</a>
              and placed into a public GitHub repository under one of
              your partner's accounts. Place a footnote to this
              URL somewhere in your final pdf. This is not required but
              it is recommended to place your code under some
              <a href="http://choosealicense.com/">open-source license</a>
              such as <a href="http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/">MIT</a>.
						</li>
					</ul>


					<h3>Due Dates:</h3>

					<ul>
						<br>
						<li>
							&#9679; <b><i>May 24: &nbsp;Final Project Proposal</i></b><br>
							Typed (LaTeX)
              one page maximum explaining your problem, what data
              sets you are likely to use (you must find some candidates),
              who your partners are, and what methods (of those you know of)
              you think you might use. Note that this is not 100% final
              but it should be within some epsilon of your final project.
						</li>
						<br>
						<li>
							&#9679; <b><i>May 31: &nbsp;Midterm Progress Presentation</i></b><br>
							Maximum 8 minutes presentation detailing your progress towards
							your goal. You do not need to have significant progress, but
							you should specify the problem you are going to work on,
							which algorithms you have used, any research you have done to
							approach the problem and what you have found, any specific
							python libraries you are going to use and , any
              necessary insight (mathematical or otherwise) you have
              conjured, etc. If you have not done a lot of research yet,
              you must still show everything you have tried.
						</li>
						<br>

						<li>
							&#9679; <b><i>June 19: &nbsp;Final Project Submission</i></b> <br>
							Only one copy of each item need be turned in per group.
							Must conform to
              the requirements above (NOTE: NIPS papers have a hard cap
              at 9 pages and a cap at 8. Read the formatting requirements!)
						</li>
						<br>

						<li>
							&#9679; <b><i>June 19: Final Project Presentation</i></b> <br>
							10 minutes long. The instructor and
              class will choose up to 10 extraordinary presentations
              to be shown on the last day of presentation. We will allocate
              3 days for the class to present during these two weeks
              according with everyone's schedules.
