						<h3>Course Requirements and Evaluation:</h3>
						<p>
							&#9679; <b><i>Reading Summaries</i></b> <br>

							All readings are compulsory, but some are more compulsory
							than others.<br>

	            To encourage the goal of reading active research in
	            the field, half-page reading summaries for all non-Murphy readings
	            will be due at the beginning of class. They must be
	            legible, and demonstrate that you have read the
	            paper with a high degree of confidence. Credit will be
	            given on a 0-10 scale for each summary. Your summaries
	            should be written at a high level, and should focus on
	            the main point of the readings (ie. avoid complicated
	            math). As long as your summary is reasonable, you will
	            be given full credit. <br><br>


							&#9679; <b><i>Homework</i></b> <br>

							The homework is due at the beginning of each lecture. There will
							be two parts for each assignment: math and coding. The math part
							is due on Wenesday, and the coding part is due on Monday.
							The homework is split approximately evenly between
	            mathematical analysis and extension of our course material
	            and application of algorithms to real world data.<
							<br><br>
							For coding: You are required to use Python3. The starter code is
							provided for each coding problem. Numpy and Pandas are two
							important python libraries to know for coding assignment for this
							course. If you never use these libraries before, make sure you
							check out the tutorials online before starting the first assignment.
							<i>Note:</i> when doing the coding problem, you are not allowed to use
							any machine learning libraries, like sklearn, that have the
							algorithms already implemented.<br><br>


							&#9679; <b><i>Examination</i></b> <br>

							The midterm will be 3 hour take-home exam covering all topics
							seen until October 10 (inclusive). You will receive the exam
							in class on Oct. 10 (the Monday before break) and have until
							Oct. 24 (the Monday after break) to complete it. More detailed
							instructions will be given on the exam, but you are to turn the exam
							into the designated box outside Prof. Gu's office immediately after
							completion, or, if she is not there, under the door. The hard
							cut-off for handing the exam in is at the beginning of class
							on Oct. 24.<br><br>

							&#9679; <b><i>Final Project</i></b> <br>

							The final project is the largest component of the course.
							Each student will discover, explore, and attack a real world
							problem of your choosing. The detailed description and requirements
							for the final project can be found under the "Final Project" tab.
							<br><br>

							&#9679; <b><i>GitHub</i></b> <br>

							As we stated in the course overview, students are expected to
							become comfortable with Github. Hence, each student is required
							to create a Github account for coding assignment submission and
							final project submission. If you already have a Github account,
							that's perfect. If not, please create a personal Github account
							and go over the tutorials online.<br>
							<i>Note:</i> Please make sure to send the username of your Github
							account to TA for homework grading.
						</p>


						<h3>Classroom Policies:</h3>
						<p>
							&#9679; <b><i>Attendence</i></b> <br>

							Attendence for each lecture is mandatory and is expected of all
							class members. if you're going to miss a lecture, it is neccessary
							for you to inform the instructor as soon as possible. You are also
							responsible for obtaining notes from another class member.
							<br><br>


							&#9679; <b><i>Devices</i></b> <br>

							You are welcome to use your computer or tablet for note-taking
							(the PowerPoint slides will also be posted shortly after the
							lecture for your convenience).
						</p>

						<h3>Diabilities:</h3>
						<p>
							Students who need disability-related accommodations are
							encouraged to discuss this with the instructor as soon as
							possible.
